# Github Copilot/Codex Text

POC Concept:
- Lets explore github copilot & see how well it can suggest code for python3 & Java. Lets explore for simple one-liners, full functions. Lets explore both in the space of simple java, simple python, data science in python, feature engineering in python, and more. 

Conclusions:
- Copilot is decent. Often suggestions make sense for even complex requests. Often suggestions dont function for even simple requests like "create a object detection model using pytorch, use transfer learning with vgg". 
- However, it will pull from your local code base & extend your coding patterns. In these instances, it can even code up BERT models for example & then you can request it make adjustments.
- It can suggest functions, suggest one-liners, and even adjust functions along the way. It uses the context of your docsigns, function names & inputs, comments, and other functions to direct & suggest further code.
